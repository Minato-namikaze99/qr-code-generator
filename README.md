# QR-code-generator
This is a QR Code Generator that I made using Python. I used the ***"qrcode"*** library in Python

For this, I had to install two libraries, i.e., ***Pillow*** and ***qrcode***.
To install these libraries, you can either create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.

These libraries can be installed using the ***pip*** command in Command Prompt or in Terminal.

The commands which are to be run in the CMD or terminal for installing the libraries are - 
```
pip install Pillow
pip install qrcode
```

> Note that the above commands are to be run one after another.

After installing these succesfully, you can run the Python File. 

Do remember that the image to be inserted in the QR code must be saved into the directory locally and should not be an online link.
